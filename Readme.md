## Introduction

It is mainly used client-side, implemented as part of a web browser allowing improvements to the user interface and dynamic web pages3 and server-side JavaScript (SsJs). His use in non-web applications, for example in Pdf documents, desktop applications (mainly widgets) is also important. As of 2012, all modern browsers are fully compatible with EcmaScript 5.1, a version of JavaScript. Older browsers support at least EcmaScript 3. The 6th edition was released in July 2015.

## Important information and frequently asked questions

Currently the course is in process. The basic, intermediate and backend blocks have been started, and that was
the initial objective of the project. And then I don't rule out adding new lessons in the future, but I think
which for the moment can serve as a basis for anyone who wants to start learning this language.

*As soon as the course continues I will update the repository and notify the networks.
Thank you very much for all the support shown!
